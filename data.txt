The current database setup is using Firebase's Firestore. Its a NoSQL cloud database that syncs irrigation system status, and stores irrigation history in real time.

To setup the database, this android app project must be added to a Firebase project. Please refer to the README.md on how to do this.
Once added to Firebase:
- On Firebase console > Build > Firestore Database > Create Database
- Choose which server is closest to you
- Pick 'Start in Production Mode'
- Update your database rules as follows:

```
rules_version = '2';
      service cloud.firestore {
        match /databases/{database}/documents {
          match /{document=**} {
            allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
          }
        }
      }
```

The rules above restrict access to your database to only signed in users within the app
